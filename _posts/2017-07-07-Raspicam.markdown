I designed and built equipment necessesary for Raspberry Pi Cameras to operate in the difficult environment of tokamaks. These cameras faced high magnetic fields, intense radiation bombardment, and substantial heat excursions. These simple and low-cost systems were able to outperform similar older systems at a dramatically reduced price with simpler implementation.  While the operation of the Raspberry Pi camera is well-documented and straight-forward, this new equipment interfaced with the computer, electrical and mechanical systems of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak.

This required the following:

<ul>
  <li>Coding an interface with the experimental data system</li>
  <li>Design and manufacture of camera mounting structure</li>
  <li>Optimization of the optics for individual views</li>
  <li>Isolation of the electrical triggering</li>
  <li>Placing power supplies away from high magnetic fields</li>
</ul>

The end result of this work can be seen in the spactacular conclusion of the plasmas (known as a 'disruption') shown both in the video (which I uploaded to Youtube) and the introductory image at the top of the page. These highlight the camera's robustness and exhibits the ability of such simple systems to collect such unique and interesting images.

Depending on the settings and optics, it can take high quality 5MP pictures 10 times a second all the way to 640x480 resolution at 90 frames per second. The picture and video are from these two ends of this acquisition spectrum. Limitations in the lenses in this case reduce crisp quality of the full images, but are still spactacular in their own way.  In the end, I installed four of these cameras at various locations around the tokamak, each of which yielding a unique perspective on the world of high-temperature plasma physics.

<h3> Design and manufacture of the camera mounting structure </h3>

Tokamaks often have compilcated and  limited space due to  the extreme mechanical and electromagnetic environment interfacing with vacuum equipment. Optimal placement of
