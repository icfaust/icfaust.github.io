I wanted a straightforward, easy-to-install, and fast way of calculating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricubic_interpolation">tricubic interpolants</a> on a three dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grid">regular grid</a> in Python and set out to do it myself. I wrote one in C which could be accessed by numpy using f2py, and it can compete or beat the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/dierckx/"> equivalent bicubic interpolating splines</a> in scipy in speed (in some cases). The increased speed came through the addition of a finite difference matrix and by coefficient reuse.

This required the following:

<ul>
  <li>An easy object-oriented interface</li>
  <li>Inclusion of finite differences and sorting</li>
  <li>Interfacing with f2py</li>
  <li>Managing boundary conditions</li>
</ul>

While there are implementations of tricubic interpolation in a number of languages (including <a href="https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/TriCubicSpline.html">java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/danielguterding/pytricubic">C++ and Python</a>), there wasn't one that matched all of these requirements. Completing this task was actually more difficult that I had originally imagined, first off the original work by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nme.1296/abstract"> <i>Lekien and Marsden </i> </a> did not include the necessary original matrix needed for the interpolation in the paper (as it is as 64x64 matrix) and the linked website containg the matrix no longer exists (though someone seems to have found a version and pushed it to <a href="https://github.com/nbigaouette/libtricubic">Github</a>). After finding it after some searching, I went to work.

Initially I need to say that my version builds from Lekien's original, so in a way this isn't something groundbreaking. However, I extend it by making it more user friendly with vector and arrays, iterates through the evaluation in a somewhat intelligent way, and speeds the derivative calculations for a regular grid by including a finite difference calculation in the spline coefficient calculation (removing all need for calculating derivatives). All of these really help to serve in making it more reasonable to work with.

The reason why its written in C is three-fold. First, the original was written in C and was a good starting point (allowing for progressive debugging of the output to compare against the original). Secondly and most importantly the code needed to be fast enough to compete with other two-dimensional interpolators.  Serious time and effort by many programmers and mathematicians have gone into making extremely fast 2D interpolating schemes in base lower-level languages (<i>e.g.</i> FORTRAN, C and C++). It was my hope to be somewhere in a similar ballpark in speed even though I knew the amount of computation for tricubic interpolation would be greater. Thirdly, C and Python can be directly and natively interfaced easily through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> package and through <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/">f2py</a> (part of <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>). This would allow for direct access with Python (also reducing the barrier for its use). 

<h3>Dependency can be your enemy</h3>

One things that bugs me a lot are software packages which require a lot of other programs to be installed to operate.  When working on a stable system which is relatively common (like a standard architecture computer with a reasonable operating system) there are usually no problems.  Most of the time you can even get a precompiled binary. But if you go to a rarer system type, whether its Solaris, a weird linux distro or an older i386 computer, the higher the probability you will run into an issue and you will have to install by hand. The operation and installation of your software is now determined by the operability and install-ability of someone else's work. The weak link in the robustness of your software moves into a distint region of 'unknown unknowns'. Nothing annoys me more than trying to solve a clash between source code and a specific architecture for code I haven't written. In this way dependency of code can really be an enemy.

It is my opinion that code should be written to depend on as few packages as possible to operate and should focus on using dependable, common and vetted software to build off of. The more mainstream the package, the more likely that there is someone else who has already faced the problem and solved it (super important for Solaris and stackoverflow).

On the other hand, there is something to be said for not 'reinventing the wheel'. For example, you will never beat BLAS/ATLAS at doing matrix methods, so don't do your own QR decomposition algorithm. However, in any case that you do find a 'plug and play' solution, ask yourself if it is worth it. The answer can be highly contextual too: if it is personal scripting for a specific problem then installing the package and using it is probably a good idea.  If you want some code for others to routinely use for an indeterminant amount of time, its probably a bad choice.

This long-winded philosophical diatribe is a motivation for the use of f2py. f2py is a program which can compile FORTRAN and C code for use in numpy/Python. Numpy is very commonly installed with python for scientific computing. In this case, I knew that others would be using my software on any number of operating systems and computers. Therefore by having it only depend on one code ontop of Python, and being extremely common would greatly simplify installation and debugging. This interfacing code is utilized extensively for giving python some 'speed' by relying on the underlying speed of FORTRAN.

f2py and C is less common, but
