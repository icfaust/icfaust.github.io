I wanted to build an Internet of Things (IoT) device and through that I could develop my skills in microcontrollers and design integration.  I also wanted to make it as simple as possible while also being useful and robust. With this in mind I have designed and built a device which connects to the internet, polls a website for a JSON, extracts a specific number (the experimental shot number or air quality index, for example) and displays it via an SPI-connected 8-digit 7-segment display. It feels like the 21st century equivalent of a bed-side clock. This project really highlights the revolution in design allowing for a hobbyist to make complicated products while maintaining low development costs and fast design processes.    

Doing this required three different segments, designing an integration between pieces

This required the following:

<ul>
  <li>Temp1</li>
  <li>Temp2</li>
</ul>

Temporary

Depending on the settings and optics, it can take high quality 5MP pictures 10 times a second all the way to 640x480 resolution at 90 frames per second. The picture and video are from these two ends of this acquisition spectrum. Limitations in the lenses in this case reduce crisp quality of the full images, but are still spactacular in their own way.  In the end, I installed four of these cameras at various locations around the tokamak, each of which yielding a unique perspective on the world of high-temperature plasma physics.
