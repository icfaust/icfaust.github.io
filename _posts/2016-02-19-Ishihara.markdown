In honor of some of my colorblind students at MIT, I wrote a code which can generate an  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_test">Ishihara test</a> from sets of simply-connected polygons. The outcome is a working example of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/beast/www/">'Beast'</a> hall symbol.

This required the following:

<ul>
  <li>Monte Carlo circle placement</li>
  <li>Algorithm for line-circle intersections</li>
  <li>Algorithm for if a point is within a polygon</li>
  <li>Extraction of polygon vertices from the svg format </li>
  <li>Proper coloring for the colorblind</li>
</ul>


<h3>Monte Carlo circle placement</h3>

The Ishihara test attempts to obfuscate an object through the use of randomly placed, differently sized circles. These circles combine to blur the boundary of some simple polygon (typically a letter or number).  Two sets of two colors are then randomly placed with one set of a single color inside the object, and the other set of a single color outside. Usually this is a dark and light red, and then a dark and light green.  Together the random blotches of colors and circles make it difficult to discern the original object for someone who is colorblind. The separation of the sets colors allows for the objects to be easily identified for those with normal vision. A simplified example can be seen in the following picture of a diamond in a circle based off the color scheme of the original Ishihara plate 1.

Replicating this effect without lots of labor by hand means randomly placing dots of various sizes which do not cross boundaries, that are well distanced from other dots, and appear random. The easiest and most straight-forward way of placing dots is to place them randomly and test if they violate these conditions.  This simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo method</a> rests on being able to create an array of valid dots and polygon lines which are compared to the next random dot. Each possible circle is tested against the lines and circles previously placed for a large sample of possible circles. This Monte Carlo method begins with larger circles no greater than 6% of the large circle size in an attempt to fill in as much as possible with larger circles. Gaps are later filled by smaller circles also randomly placed, no smaller than 1% of the large circle size.  This methodology reasonably reproduces an Ishihara plate.   

<h3>Line-plane intersections</h3>

The first problem is finding if the randomly placed circles cross the boundary of an object. The object is defined by a set of straight lines which closes upon itself, each of which must be tested against the tested circle. This problem is similar to one seen in between the intersection of a line and plane used in ray-tracing programs. Solving for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-plane_intersection">intersection of a line and plane</a> is a straightforward 3x3 matrix inversion. In two dimensions it is the intersection of two lines. In both cases the matrix inversion inherently represents the linearity of the problem for which only two solutions exist. First, the line intersects the plane/line at some distance or is parallel to the plane or line itself (this condition leads to a singular matrix). 

Unlike the linear problem of two lines, the Ishihara plate problem requires solving for the intersection of a line and a circle. The solution only requires the use of a quadratic equation, yielding three possible answers. Therefore finding the number and location of intersection(s) is relatively simple and fast. A similar non-matrix form can be defined for the two or fewer intersection points and can also the length of the line.

The center and radius of the circle is defined as the vector xc and r respectively, and the endpoints of the two lines as vectors x0 and x1. The  The line is defined from x0 to x1 with vector v1, and a vector v2 is defined from the starting point of the line to the center of the circle. The length along v1 define
