SPRED spectrometer used on the <a href="http://www.ipp.mpg.de/ippcms/de/pr/forschung/asdex/index">ASDEX-Upgrade tokamak</a> at the <a href="http://www.ipp.mpg.de/">Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Garching</a> is a work-horse spectrometer for finding impurities in the plasma. Built by a now-defunct exterior firm, the angle of the grating (critical for the proper scattering the light) became misaligned over its long operational lifetime.  It became my job to understand this spectrometer and return it to operation as best I could.

Impurities are defined as elements in the plasma outside the main atomic species (which is often an isotope of Hydrogen). SPRED stands for Survey, Poor Resolution, Extended Domain which defines a wide generally uncharacterized wavelength region.  It has existed on the ASDEX-Upgrade from nearly the beginning of its operation in 1991.  This spectrometer and many others of similar design on other tokamaks derive from the original built in 1982 by american <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ep/Faculty/Fonck_Raymond/">Professor Fonck</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Large_Torus">PLT tokamak</a>.  These other impurity elements are heavier with more protons and consequently tightly bind the orbiting electrons.  Plasmas which strip the oribiting electrons can strip some electrons or change the energy levels, leading to higher energy photons to be emitted than Hydrogen.

The higher energy photons (light) are in the ultraviolet or X-ray range.  The SPRED spectrometer measures impurity line emission in what is known as the 'Extreme UltraViolet' (EUV) or the 'Vacuum UltraViolet' (VUV) range.  This light cannot penetrate deeply through most materials or gasses (hence the name vacuum UV), measurment of these wavelengths require special detectors (deep-depletion/ back-thinned CCDs or MCPS) under vacuum.

This was a tough problem, as it had the following large issues:  it had no major documentation of its designs (outside the specification of the gratings), there was no way of accurately calibrating the grating angle in place, the spectrometer is one-of-a-kind, the system could only be fully verified for operation at the very end (i.e. under vacuum).  These problems were systematically retired through the following steps:

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of previous operation</li>
  <li>Reverse engineering the spectrometer without complete disassembly</li>
  <li>Designing and implementing a system for angluar calibration of a EUV/VUV grating</li>
  <li>Fixtures for in-place verification</li>
  <li>Analysis of spectrometer operation</li>
</ul>
